# CS-Status

A CrawlorSoft Open-Source release for a lightweight AngularJS status bar and notification system for web applications.

## Background

While using web applications, the user is repeatedly bombarded with floating notification bubbles and information.
Occasionally, these notifications cover important fields, data, or other information.  While these instances are rare
in a well designed user interface, they can still occur and cause incredible user confusion and difficulties.

CS-Status is designed to alleviate this issue by removing or preventing the pop-in nature of notifications
while maintaining a persistent list of notifications for the user to review.

## General Functionality

1. Status notifications may be placed into a status bar, located at the top or bottom of the page.
2. The status notification may have the following transition effects to draw attention to them:
    1. ***TBD***
3. Notifications may pop-in to the page, and then be transferred to the status bar in a smooth transition.
4. The notification area of the status bar may be clicked on and reveal a pop-up drawer.
