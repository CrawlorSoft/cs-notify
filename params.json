  "body": "# CS-Status\r\n\r\nA CrawlorSoft Open-Source release for a lightweight AngularJS status bar and notification system for web applications.\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nWhile using web applications, the user is repeatedly bombarded with floating notification bubbles and information.\r\nOccasionally, these notifications cover important fields, data, or other information.  While these instances are rare\r\nin a well designed user interface, they can still occur and cause incredible user confusion and difficulties.\r\n\r\nCS-Status is designed to alleviate this issue by removing or preventing the pop-in nature of notifications\r\nwhile maintaining a persistent list of notifications for the user to review.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nThe cs-notify package can be installed from either [NPM](http://npmjs.com) or [Bower](http://bower.io) for use in web\r\napplications.\r\n\r\nTo install via **Bower**: `bower install --save cs-notify`.\r\n\r\nTo install via **NPM**: `npm install --save-dev cs-notify`.\r\n\r\n## Build From Source\r\n\r\nIf you would like to build the package from source yourself you can do so as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/CrawlorSoft/cs-notify.git cs-notify\r\ncd cs-notify\r\ngulp\r\ngulp e2e\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe gulp e2e step is optional and will run the e2e tests in Chrome to verify basic functionality.\r\n\r\n## Simple Usage\r\n\r\nTo add the notification drawer to a web application with glyphicons, add the following to your status bar:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n    <cs-notifications data-ng-icon-set=\"iconSet\"></cs-notifications>\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then:\r\n1. Register `cs-notify` as a dependency of your web app; and\r\n2. Add an import of csNotificationService to the page controller and capture the glyphicon icon set.\r\n\r\nFor example, if your page controller is currently:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nangular.module('myApp', [])\r\n    .controller('PageController', function() {\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would change to:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nangular.module('myApp', ['cs-notify'])\r\n    .controller('PageController', ['csNotificationService', '$scope', function(csns, $scope) {\r\n        $scope.iconSet = csns.bootstrapGlyphiconIconSet;\r\n    }]);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## General Functionality\r\n\r\n1. Status notifications may be placed into a status bar, located at the top or bottom of the page.\r\n2. The notification area of the status bar may be clicked on and reveal a pop-up drawer.\r\n\r\n## Upcoming Functionality\r\n\r\n1. The ability to have an icon only status area with a badge indicating the number of notifications received in this session.\r\n2. The ability to have notifications pop into the page, then travel to the cs-notification area.\r\n\r\n",
